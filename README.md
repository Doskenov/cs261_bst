# A simple binary search tree implementation

This repository contains a binary search tree (BST) for storing `int`s.  The BST is specified in `bst.h` and implemented in `bst.c`.  There is also a small program in `test_bst.c` to demonstrate the BST.  You can compile the test program using the provided `Makefile` and run it as follows:
```
make
./test_bst
```
